# Fast Food POS (Point of Sale) System
This project is created for use in the 2024 釧路高等工業専門学校(Kushiro National Institute of Technology) school festival. Specifically, the 4th year Computer Science bazaar and exhibition. <br>
The repository contains 2 seperate elements which includes the backend and the frontend. The backend manages incoming orders and neatly sorts them. The frontend program itself is comprised of 2 parts; a KVS (Kitchen Video System) as well as the POS (Point of Sale) system itself.
